		<h1>Journal Entry 9/26/2023</h1>
		<p>Today was a decent day at work esspecially getting to see Sam and Aakriti at work and the day not being
            to hectic overall. I am still really struggling both with this appartment and my lack of job satisfaction
            which is definitely something I need to address.
